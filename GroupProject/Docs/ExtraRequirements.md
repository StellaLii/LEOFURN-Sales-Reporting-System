#### This includes all the non-functional requirements of the system.

##### Security 
- This is a simple user app which is mainly for local use only. It wonâ€™t allow have any internet connections to outside world, therefore it will be safe from most of the attacks which occur due to network communication.
- The app will not need too much permissions from the user, only needed permission might be of `storage` to save database file. 

##### Reliability 
- We will validate/constrain all the user input types to avoid any invalid input crashing the app. And we assume the store server is reliable in our project.

##### Maintainability 
- We assume the store server is self-maintained by itself. Other than that, we don't think this app is complicated to maintain.
- Addition of new features will need newer releases.
